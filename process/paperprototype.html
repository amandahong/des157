			<h2>summary</h2>
			<p>
				My paper prototypes showed how the user will click through the instructions for my animated recipe. It featured a home page with different recipes, an ingredients check list, and a click-and-drag page of graphics that have accompanying pop-up descriptions.
				My users were extremely helpful in helping me add buttons to the interface. They pointed out that some of the pages didn't tell them if they should continue clicking or if it would animate on its own, so I added more descriptive buttons for them. They also wanted to know how much the stories would tie in with the overall recipe, which I will clarify in the future prototypes.
