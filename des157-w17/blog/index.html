			I often use slack as a means of communication between my student organizations and extracurricular activities. The visual design is highly effective because it keeps everything organized and accessible. To the left, there is a navigation bar that keeps all the different “channels” or chats grouped, as well as personal chats with team members. Each chat window has its own quick navigation bar across the top for you to favorite, add/remove, pin, or customize. The part that I appreciate most about slack is its seamless connection between web, app, and mobile app. You can access all your content across all platforms, and there is no loss of ease or aesthetic. Furthermore, while the main features, like channels and teams, are set, there are many more features that can be customized to the liking of different groups. You can change display colors between teams, add avatars onto both your profile and individual chat messages, direct message select groups of people within a larger chat, create polls and question slots, and many more. Slack keeps all its content neat, and the aesthetic of their application is admirable. The ease of customization fits in perfectly among the overall standardization of use, making slack a valuable communication tool for today’s generation.
