			<h2>summary</h2>
			<p>
				My storyboard outlines the use of my platform as a conversation starter and educator. After running through the storyboard with my peers, I was able to refine it and define the exact audience and situation that it would ideally be used in. My platform
				would be used by young adults who seek more connections to their home culture, and use their skills in tech to find these connections. My peers pointed out that there should be more incentives to use the site, so I will be further exploring a system
				where using the site can lead to some kind of external rewards, such as discounts at local stores or coupons for restaurants.
