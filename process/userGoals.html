				<h3>How will your users understand the content of the project?</h3>
				<p>
					The users will be able to see the visual graphics that represent the cooking recipe of my project. Through further interaction, they will be able to gain more access to the additional content that is linked.
				</p>
				<h3>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</h3>
				<p>
					The primary objectives will be represented through the short story-like captions that accompany each interaction of the website. The underlying message about cultural appreciation and diversity will be further explained through a small side tidbit, which users can read through if they're interested.
				</p>
				<h3>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</h3>
				<p>
					My users will need straightforward and easy to find animations. I intend to create these features as a simple hover or click option (perhaps accompanied by tool tips), which will guide the user through the site. Their first instinct will already be to move their mouse around the food graphics, as they will be the center piece of my site.
				</p>
				<h3>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you are creating? </h3>
				<p>
					I'm estimating that my user will most likely be young adults in the 18-25 range who are looking to diversify their knowledge of different cultures. They would be fairly tech-savvy, which would make my media very easy to create.
