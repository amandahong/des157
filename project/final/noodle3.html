            Black bean cold noodles, which are also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhajiangmian" target="_blank">zhajiangmian</a>, is a traditional Chinese dish that was first made in 1905, at a restaurant in Incheon Chinatown, Shangdong
            Province of China. It began as a simple peasant dish that was simple and cheap to make, as bean paste was very accessible to most Chinese citizens. It has since made its way into many other cultures, notably taking another form as the Korean
            noodle dish called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jajangmyeon" target="_blank">jajangmyeon</a>. Both the Korean and Chinese dishes are similar in overall recipes, with just a few variations in ingredients due to region differences.
            For example, Chinese recipes often use a yellow soybean paste, while Korean recipes lean toward dark soybean paste.

            Regardless of the many variations that exist today, this noodle dish remains one of the most popular and, in my personal opinion, delicious staples of Asian cuisine. It is a dish that my mother and grandmothers all know how to make to perfection. The
            best part is that they always tailor the recipe exactly how I like it, and so it remains a staple of my childhood memories. Both the preparation and consumption of this dish holds a dear place in my heart and in my familyâ€™s traditions, and
            I hope I can pass this on to the next generation of young Asian Americans.
