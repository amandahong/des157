				For my studio 5, I wanted to explore simple animations paired wih SVG images. I initially discovered the library called <a href="http://snapsvg.io/" target="_blank">snap.svg</a>, which allows you to use SVG images in various animations while allowing more control over the various aspects of a design. However, as I was learning the library, I found that although I understood the basics of manipulating parts of an SVG image, I could not grasp the more intricate code that ran the majority of snap. I decided to focus on another library I discovered while I was researching snap.svg, which is called anime. <a href="http://anime-js.com/" target="_blank">Anime</a> is a library that allows you to animate your graphic content with a bunch of pre-written and easy to read commands. It simplifies down a lot of the functions that I learned previously in this class, and it helped me a lot in animating my graphic. However, I also wanted my graphic to animate on mouse click or hover, which is something that I haven't quite figured out with anime yet. This is something I'm going to continue to work with as I move forward with my ISEA project.

				I created this interface based on my garden back at home. I used 4 vector images, paired with a timeline underneath that describes each plant. My 3 tool tips are over the header, the images, and the timeline, and each tip prompts the user to further explore the interface and find the bits of info stored here and there. I think this is supports effective interface design because it ensures that the user can find the small hidden bits on the page, especially if they're confused and hovering their mouse. I also included hover descriptions over each part of the timeline, which is effective design because it only reveals the information when the user is interested, and otherwise it remains hidden. Lastly, I added a butterfly animation in the background, which adds to the interest in the interface design, as it adds a small moving element to entertain the user between browsing.

				I made my interface on the objects in my bag. I scanned 5 items and created a horizontal table of photos. I created a header image of my backpack, which is an interactive button that shows the message, "Welcome to my bag!" upon click. The photos have
				a color overlay and upon a mouse hover, the overlay disappears and shows the image in full opacity. Clicking on each photo makes a popup box appear with a short description of the item. There is also an "x" button to close out each popup. I found
				that having a hover that changed the color overlay was effective because it put the focus on each individual image as the mouse moved. The background photo of the bag is interesting and subtle because it's at a low opacity until the mouse hovers,
				which then brings it into focus and full image opacity. Lastly, the popup boxes are effective because they offer some information that must be selected by the user to read.

				The form I chose to evaluate is the online job application from Gap Inc. Overall, the design of the form is extremely simple but aesethically lackluster when it comes to communicating its purpose and being informative. The hierarchy is direct, with a
				large header and basic boxes and drop down menus that follow a short description. However, all the boxes vary in width, with no indication of purpose or distinction. The form has decent clarity, as it is very bare bones with the information needed.
				However, there are no icons or colors to help with understanding the categories, which could have helped the ease of filling out the form. Lastly, the purpose of the form is rather bland, and though the design is simple and easy to navigate, it could
				use improvements in terms of higher user engagement and clarity.

				I often use slack as a means of communication between my student organizations and extracurricular activities. The visual design is highly effective because it keeps everything organized and accessible. To the left, there is a navigation bar that keeps
				all the different “channels” or chats grouped, as well as personal chats with team members. Each chat window has its own quick navigation bar across the top for you to favorite, add/remove, pin, or customize. The part that I appreciate most about
				slack is its seamless connection between web, app, and mobile app. You can access all your content across all platforms, and there is no loss of ease or aesthetic. Furthermore, while the main features, like channels and teams, are set, there are many
				more features that can be customized to the liking of different groups. You can change display colors between teams, add avatars onto both your profile and individual chat messages, direct message select groups of people within a larger chat, create
				polls and question slots, and many more. Slack keeps all its content neat, and the aesthetic of their application is admirable. The ease of customization fits in perfectly among the overall standardization of use, making slack a valuable communication
				tool for today’s generation.
