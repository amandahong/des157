				The form I chose to evaluate is the online job application from Gap Inc. Overall, the design of the form is extremely simple but aesethically lackluster when it comes to communicating its purpose and being informative. The hierarchy is direct, with a large header
				and basic boxes and drop down menus that follow a short description. However, all the boxes vary in width, with no indication of purpose or distinction. The form has decent clarity, as it is very bare bones with the information needed. However,
				there are no icons or colors to help with understanding the categories, which could have helped the ease of filling out the form. Lastly, the purpose of the form is rather bland, and though the design is simple and easy to navigate, it could use improvements
				in terms of higher user engagement and clarity.

				I often use slack as a means of communication between my student organizations and extracurricular activities. The visual design is highly effective because it keeps everything organized and accessible. To the left, there is a navigation bar that keeps
				all the different “channels” or chats grouped, as well as personal chats with team members. Each chat window has its own quick navigation bar across the top for you to favorite, add/remove, pin, or customize. The part that I appreciate most about
				slack is its seamless connection between web, app, and mobile app. You can access all your content across all platforms, and there is no loss of ease or aesthetic. Furthermore, while the main features, like channels and teams, are set, there are many
				more features that can be customized to the liking of different groups. You can change display colors between teams, add avatars onto both your profile and individual chat messages, direct message select groups of people within a larger chat, create
				polls and question slots, and many more. Slack keeps all its content neat, and the aesthetic of their application is admirable. The ease of customization fits in perfectly among the overall standardization of use, making slack a valuable communication
				tool for today’s generation.
