            <h2>PENS PENS PENS</h2>
            <p>
                Maybe it's because I lose them a lot, or because my calligraphy mood is constantly changing, but I always have tons and tons of pens with me in my bag. I usually carry a few pens for notes, a few for sketching, a pencil for test taking, and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shinhan-Touch-Twin-Brush-Marker/dp/B009CV49VO" target="_blank">nice brush pen</a> for doodling in my notebook!

            <h2>CUSTOM NOTEBOOK</h2>
            <p>
                This notebook is special because it was custom made for me! It's a Moleskin that's been hand-embossed by an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/electriceunice/" target="_blank"> Instagram calligrapher named Eunice.</a> I use this notebook for taking notes occasionally, but usually it becomes my go-to place for random scribbles.

            <h2>CHARGER ORGANIZER</h2>
            <p>
                I own one of those obscenely long Mac charger cables, and this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quirky-Powercurl-Wire-Organizer-PPRCP-45GY/dp/B00KFS5L8I" target="_blank">cord-wrap organizer</a> is my favorite accessory of life. It keeps my cords coiled up under a silicone cover until I need to unravel them, so my charger is always customized to the length I need, and neat in my bag!

            <h2>TEA PACKETS</h2>
            <p>
                I LOVE TEA. I always carry a thermos, and since hot water is free on campus, having a few tea bags stashed in my bag ensures that I can always have a hot drink ready to go, for FREE. My favorite flavor is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genmaicha" target="_blank">genmaicha</a>, which translates to roasted rice green tea. Yuuuuuuum :9

            <h2>EARPHONES</h2>
            <p>
                Earphones are one of the most important things I bring to campus. I'm most productive when I can enjoy my music, so I always have my earphones, and another backup pair in my bag just in case I forget the main ones. My current favorite song right now is <a href ="https://soundcloud.com/stanaj/changed" target="_blank">Changed by Stanaj.</a>
