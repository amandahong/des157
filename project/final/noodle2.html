                <strong>Step 1:</strong> Boil 1 cup chicken broth in a large pot.
            </p>
            <p class="extra">
                The broth will add a slight flavor to the plain noodles, which is a simple cooking trick my mother taught me.
            </p>
            <p class="extra">
                After cooking, the broth can also be saved as a simple chicken soup. My family often serves this as an appetizer dish before the main noodle dish.
            </p>

            <div class="close">&otimes;</div>
            <p>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong> Add Chinese style noodles to boiling broth, boil until cooked (3-5 minutes).
            </p>
            <p class="extra">
                These noodles are usually made from a more sensitive flour, and a firmer noodle texture is highly desirable in many regions of China.
            </p>
            <p class="extra">
                After noodles are ready, rinse in cold water, drain, toss with rice wine if desired, and move to a bowl. My home recipe uses white vinegar to add a tart undertone of flavor.

        <aside id="threeInfo">
            <div class="close">&otimes;</div>
            <p>
                <strong>Step 3:</strong> Add black bean paste (chilled) over noodles.
            </p>
            <p class="extra">
                Black bean paste is made of fermented or pulverized mung beans, which are mostly cultivated in India, China, and Southeast Asia. They have both a savory and sweet flavor, and are often used in rich rice or noodle dishes.
            </p>
            <p class="extra">
                If desired, black bean paste can be cooked with ground pork for a more wholesome sauce. My family recipe also adds garlic, firm tofu, and cabbage into the sauce.
            </p>

        <aside id="fourInfo">
            <div class="close">&otimes;</div>
            <p>
                <strong>Step 4:</strong> Add sliced chilled cucumber on top of the noodles and sauce.
            </p>
            <p class="extra">
                Cucumbers are a favorite in Chinese culture because of their light, refreshing, and naturally hydrating taste, which is particularly welcome in the humid climates of Asia.
            </p>
            <p class="extra">
                I personally love cucumbers because my family uses them as a cool side dish to compliment the more traditionally salty and popular Chinese dishes that are a staple in our culture.
