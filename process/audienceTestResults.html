			<h2>summary</h2>
			<p>
				This set of user testing taught me that a lot of my hover/click commands were extremely ambiguous. Also, my popup windows overlapped and caused readability to become difficult. Many of my users would hover over something, not knowing that there was a secondary click option that goes with it. They also got confused by how many popups would come up after clicking the ingredients one by one. Lastly, one user pointed out that if someone wanted to view the recipe and ingredients on the go, it would be very difficult to continuously click through all the graphics to get the information.
			</p>
			<p>
				I plan on making the button labels more specific and easy to understand. For example, instead of writing just "No", I'm going to add, "No, go back to recipe list". I also plan on debugging the popup windows so that each new click will automatically close the previous popup. I want to make sure that there is only one box open at one time. And lastly, I am going to include downloadable PDFs for both the ingredient list and the recipe so that if users just want the instructions and not the interactive bits, they can download the PDF and leave the site.
