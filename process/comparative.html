			<h2>whats4eat</h2>
			<p>
				The whats4eat webpage is similar to my idea of having a place where people can find ethnic food recipes while also learning about different cultures around them. The interface is overall straightforward and easy to use. It has a navigation bar across
				the top that allows you to search through categories such as holidays, seasons, regions, etc. It also features its recipes in blocks of images with click through links that lead to the recipe details. There’s a place to further specify what kind of
				food you’re looking for, whether it is by cuisine or date of posting. Most of the text is sans-serif, uppercase, and very simple in appearance. The main accent color of red appears in the form of links or highlighted areas that are significant, whether
				it is a live page or a “read more”.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the interface design lacks interaction, as you can’t tell when you’re hovering over a link or not. The images are also somewhat ambiguous when it comes to “regions” or “cuisines”. There could be more differentiation between the headers and the
				navigation links, as the text and size are quite similar between the two. The responsiveness of the site also lacks fluidity, as many parts of the page become jumbled and indistinguishable when the browser window is resized.
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, the experience is simple and understandable but leaves something to be desired in terms of friendliness and interaction. You could find what you needed from this site, but you would not be tempted to explore it anymore than necessary.

			<h2>footprint calculator</h2>
			<p>
				The footprint calculator on WWF.org is a way to see roughly what your carbon footprint is on this planet. It leads you through a series of questions that explores you energy and consumption habits, and gives you an estimate of how your life affects the
				planet. The categories are sorted by bright colors, and under the category names are the number of questions that are in each category. The questions are written out in large and easy-to-read sans-serif type, and clicking on the list items automatically
				prompts the web page to move on to the next question. The side of the page also offers tips and hints about how to think about each answer to make it the most accurate answer possible. The interface is easy to navigate and the site itself only holds
				one purpose, so there are not too many other tabs or links to distract from the caluclator. The footer of the page contains some links to find out more information about the organziation.
			</p>
			<p>
				The design of the website does lack some interaction, as my first website did as well. The links don’t respond to hovering, which makes it hard to see where you can click through and where you can’t. You also cannot skip around the questions, even though
				the site makes it seem like you can by giving you all the categories laid out in the beginning. The background image is not high quality enough, as pixelation is obvious. It would also help to have more information about how to lower your footprint
				as apart of this page, so people can be more actively thinking about their usage and how to remedy it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, the website serves its purpose in showing users what their rough carbon footprint is. It uses aesthetic colors and good typography throughout the “quiz”. However, it lacks a next step to the carbon footprint dilemma. There could be more ways
				to access information about the WWF site so that users are already prompted to continue exploring the effects and ways they can lessen their impact on the earth, instead of simply coming into the site to take a small quiz and then exit out.
